# Presentation Notes

## Abstract for DEFCON 22

Rather than raid for more epic purples on your Level 90 Dwarven Warrior or boomheadshot some n00bs, you can spend your "gaming" time doing what we love best: hacking for sheer entertainment value. We'll talk about all sorts of different ways to do this, from hacking CTFs to mathlete coding competions.

Whether you're an old hand at assembly coding since the 8088 or just started learning about HTML and Excel macros; whether you smashed the stack for fun before there was profit or think the padlock in your browser means the server is secure; there's something here for you. If you come to DEFCON for the talks, this will convince you to spend more time in the competitions and CTFs.

## Outline

- Introduction
  - Motivation: because hacking is fun and you want to do your root dance
  - Overview
- Capture the Flag
  - Red Team vs Jeopardy (and variations like "Hackenger Hunt")

- Games
  - VERY brief history: Core War, Robot War
  - Examples: CodeCombat, etc. Don't forget 
- Contests
  - ACM style: largely algorithmic, sometimes string processing
  - Code golf (also regex golf and vim golf - shellcode golf is a thing too!)
  - Project Euler: math!
  - DEFCON: Crash and Compile, [DefconBots](http://defconbots.org), Schemaverse, network forensics
