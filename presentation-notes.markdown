# Presentation Notes

## Abstract for Submission

Rather than raid for more epic purples on your Level 90 Dwarven Warrior or boomheadshot some n00bs, you can spend your "gaming" time doing what we love best: hacking for sheer entertainment value. We'll talk about all sorts of different ways to do this, from hacking CTFs to mathlete coding competions.

This talk has something for all skill levels, also. Whether you're an old hand at assembly coding since the 8088 or just started learning about HTML and Excel macros; whether you smashed the stack for fun before there was profit or think the padlock in your browser means the server is secure; there's something here for you.
